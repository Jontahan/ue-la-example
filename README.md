# Learning Agents Example ðŸ¤–

Example project demonstrating the Learning Agents plugin in UE5. The project is based on the ThirdPersonExample from unreal, and includes startercontent. This is by no means a best practice demonstration, but rather a functional setup that can be used to get started with machine learning in unreal.

# Setup
The project will currently only work with a source built engine from the ue5-main branch. The latest commit confirmed to work is: [f87e28874298a7b2b493a55de98b677e2bbc2dc7](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commit/f87e28874298a7b2b493a55de98b677e2bbc2dc7)

To run training, open the ThirdPersonExample map, set "Enabled" to true on one of the blue boxes, and launch the map. You will spawn into the world as a character that can spectate the training.
